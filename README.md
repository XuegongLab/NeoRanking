# Priorization of neoantigens by machine learning

## Introduction
The accurate selection of neoantigens that bind to class I human leukocyte antigen (HLA) and are recognized by autologous T cells is a crucial step in many cancer immunotherapy pipelines.
Here we provide the python code and shell scripts that preprocesse the data matrices, perform classifier training and testing, and plot the figures of our paper [[1](#Citation)].
